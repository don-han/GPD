### Review GTD and Pomodoro

Conscious mind is that conscious mind is a focusing tool, not a storage place

Write down the outcome you want to acheive and then determine the "next physical action" required to move situation forward

the "next physical action" must be organized in a system one reviews regularly! (put it where one sees it the most) !This should be the primary interface

## Workflow: collect, process, organize , review, do (do is where pomodoro comes in)

# Collect
1. every loop has to be in the collection system, and out of your brain (things to do)
2. fewer collection buckets, the better
3. empty them regularly

# Process 
the most important part of the step

task = Task()
if not task.isActionable:
    choose (
        trash(task), 
        tickle(task), 
        reference(task), 
    )

task.determineNextAction() #NA is defined as next physical, visible activity that needs to be done to move the task to completion of goal

if nextAction.duration < 2 minutes :
    nextAction.complete()
else:
    choose(
        nextAction.delegate(),
        nextAction.defer()
    )
