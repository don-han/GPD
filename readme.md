## Getting Pomodoros Done

Mixing the best of Pomodoro and Getting Things Done (GTD), the two most well-known time management techniques.

# GUIDE
### Planning and Todo: Getting Pomodoros Done (Terminal ver.)  

- Conscious mind is a focusing tool, not a storage place

- Write down the outcome you want to acheive and then determine the "next physical action" required to move situation forward

- the "next physical action" must be organized in a system one reviews regularly! (put it where one sees it the most) !This should be the primary interface

## Workflow: collect, process, organize , review, do (do is where pomodoro comes in)

# 1. Collect
1. every loop has to be in the collection system, and out of your brain (things to do)
2. fewer collection buckets, the better
3. empty them regularly

# 2. Process - Getting "In" to Empty
the most important part of the step

task = Task()   # the thing you are trying to achieve/goal/desired outcome
if not task.isActionable:
    choose (
        trash(task),                    # delete 
        reference(task),                # reference folder
        incubate(task))                 # someday/maybe folder
        maybe/someday + calendar/tickler (time specific)
    )

task.determineNextAction() # NA is defined as next physical, visible activity that needs to be done to move the task to completion of goal
if task.isProject:
    project(task)   # need to be reviewed

if task.nextAction.duration < 2 minutes :
    task.nextAction.do()
else task.nextAction.duration >= 2 minutes:
    choose(
        task.nextAction.delegate("name"),    # Waiting for list
        task.nextAction.defer()
        # task.nextAction.actionRequired()      # next action list
        # task.nextAction.tickle()             # Calendar
    )

# 3. Organize - Setting up the right bucket
1. trash
2. Incubation tools (someday/ maybe)
3. Reference material
4. "Projects" List: add a subdivision such as personal/professional
5. Project support materials
6. Calendar: actions & informations that needs to be done on a certain time/day # sync with Google?
7. "Next Action" List # organized by context: "calls", "errands", "at home" (place)
8. "Waiting For" list # specific repeating reminders for each task

# 4. Review
Review once a week (may be an alarm?)

# 5. Do
Pomodoro

### The Process
## Business Requirements - What the program should do (setting the lower bound) (User's side)
- create a task that will be stored in Collection Box for future "Processing"
- interactive process stage that lets you "process" each task according to PTD rules
- view any list 
- Make Pomodoro counter so that you can finish off Next Actions

# Version II
- make an alarm system that will remind you to review the system at a specific interval (default: once a week)
- Implement more side of pomodoro (counting each work)

# range of requirement - What sort of requirement? (setting the upper bound)

## Technical Specification - How would you implement the requirements (Creator's side)
# command lines
gpd --help (-h) : shows help
gpd --add (-a) "argument": add a task into a collection basket
gpd --collect (-c) : add multiple tasks into a collection basket
gpd --process (-p) : process task from the most recent to the oldest chronologically
gpd --show (-s) {trash, incubation, reference, projects, support, next, waiting, calendar} : shows argument's list (default: next)
gpd --review (-r) : goes through each list ? # TODO: Find out what to do in review section
gpd --do (-d) : runs pomodoro timer with specified next action

# Classes
- tasks 
- lists 
- pomodoro timer

make the file executable
mv foobar /usr/local/bin

## Design of Solution - Pseudocode of implementation
#! /usr/bin/env python
FUCNTION MAIN - parses two argument (argparse)
CONDITION: EXECUTE FUNCTION; # first argument {help, collect, processs, show, review, do}
CONDITION: EXECUTE FUNCTION; # second argument show:{incubation, reference, projects, support, next, waiting, calendar}
IF two conditions fail -> help
ELSE EXIT

FUNCTION HELP
PRINT "Getting Pomodoros Done"
PRINT Brief introduction of GPD and what it supposes to do
PRINT General Process of running GPD (collect, process, review, do)
PRINT all the commands

FUNCTION COLLECT
NEW Task Object
ADD TO COLLECT DATABASE

FUCTION PROCESS
FOR each task:
    PROMPT task is Actionable?:
    NO -> LIST.move to appropriate list (trash, reference, incubate); END
    YES -> PROMPT what is the next action?
        more than 1 next action -> MOVE to project list
        1 next action -> PRMOPT takes less than 2 minutes?
            YES -> Run pomodoro
            NO -> Move to right list (delegate or defer)
